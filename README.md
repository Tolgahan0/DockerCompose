Utilizing Docker Compose, we can deploy a web application featuring Flask and Postgres.
In this illustration, we'll orchestrate a multi-container web application employing Flask and Postgres.

The subsequent container will execute the Flask-based web application, facilitating communication with the database container.

For a detailed deployment walkthrough, please refer to my blog post:
